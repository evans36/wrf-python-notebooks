# wrf-python-notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating basic uses of wrf-python to plot 2-D model fields, interpolate and plot model data on a specified vertical surface, and interpolate and plot model data in a vertical cross-section.

These examples are adapted from the wrf-python Plotting Examples (https://wrf-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plot.html). The two map-based examples use cartopy for mapping. The vertical cross-section example has been substantially rewritten to use pressure rather than height as the vertical coordinate.
